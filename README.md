# qtrecipe #

Recipe viewer/editor written in Python with a Qt4 frontend.

## Rationale ##

Written as a clone to replace another recipe viewer written in VB.net

The Python/Qt version adopts a similar style and uses the same recipe file
format for compatibility.

## Recipe Files ##

The file format is simple plaintext with iframe'd separators.

It would be trivial to use any format for this purpose, like JSON, XML or
YAML, if it was desired.
